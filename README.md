# Veil üßπ

> Quickly clear history, cookies, cache, and more with a single click

Veil is a lightweight Chrome extension that provides a clean, simple interface for clearing various types of browser data. Perfect for privacy-conscious users who want quick access to data clearing functions.

## Features

- üïò **Clear Browsing History** - Remove your browsing history
- üç™ **Clear Cookies** - Delete all stored cookies
- üì¶ **Clear Cache** - Clean browser cache
- üì• **Clear Downloads** - Remove download history
- üíæ **Clear Local Storage** - Clear localStorage and IndexedDB
- üîë **Clear Passwords** - Remove saved passwords
- üí£ **Clear EVERYTHING** - Nuclear option that clears all data types (excluding passwords for safety)

## Interface

The extension features a dark-themed popup with a compact 320px width design. Each clearing function has its own dedicated button with emoji icons for easy identification. All actions now require confirmation through a custom modal dialog for safety.

### Confirmation System

- **Smart Confirmations**: Each action shows a tailored confirmation dialog with specific warnings
- **Safety Features**: All destructive actions require explicit confirmation
- **Color-coded Warnings**: Different confirmation button colors indicate action severity (green for safe, orange for warning, red for dangerous)
- **Keyboard Support**: Use Escape to cancel, modal focuses on Cancel button by default

Status messages appear at the bottom to confirm successful operations, automatically disappearing after 2 seconds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

The "Clear EVERYTHING" button is extremely destructive and will remove:

- All browsing history
- All cookies and sessions (you'll be logged out of websites)
- All cached data
- Download history
- Local storage and IndexedDB data
- File systems data
- Plugin data

**Note**: For safety reasons, the "Clear EVERYTHING" option does NOT include passwords by default. Passwords must be cleared separately using the dedicated "Clear Passwords" button.

**Use with extreme caution!** These actions cannot be undone.
